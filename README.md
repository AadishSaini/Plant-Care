# PlantCare - Intelligent Plant Recognition and Care Guide App

**PlantCare** is a mobile application that uses advanced data classification models and OpenCV for accurate plant recognition. By analyzing plant features, it identifies the plant species and provides personalized, up-to-date care information to help users maintain optimal plant health. With its focus on precision, practicality, and scalability, PlantCare is designed to be an indispensable tool for plant enthusiasts, gardeners, researchers, and anyone looking to improve their plant care knowledge.

## üìã Problem Statement

In recent years, interest in indoor plants, gardening, and sustainable living has surged. However, many plant owners struggle to recognize specific plant species and lack information on proper care routines.

Real-world challenges we aim to solve:
- **Lack of plant care knowledge**: Many plant enthusiasts don‚Äôt know the exact requirements for each plant species, such as watering schedules, sunlight needs, and soil preferences.
- **Difficulty in plant identification**: Without expert knowledge, identifying plants can be challenging, and even slight misidentifications can lead to poor care practices.
- **Inconsistent and outdated information**: Often, users find conflicting plant care information from unreliable sources, making plant care confusing and ineffective.

## üåø Solution

Our app bridges this gap by combining **plant recognition technology with comprehensive plant care databases** to provide users with accurate and customized guidance. With PlantCare, users can:

- **Identify plants with precision** using real-time image recognition.
- **Access reliable, up-to-date care instructions** tailored to each identified plant.
- **Engage with a user-friendly interface** that promotes easy navigation, learning, and sharing plant care tips.

## üîë Key Features

- **Real-Time Plant Recognition**: 
  - Utilizes OpenCV and advanced classification models to analyze plant images, recognizing plant species based on unique features.
  - Provides fast and reliable plant identification, reducing guesswork for users.
  
- **Up-to-Date Care Information**:
